                <prj:note>We have listed the possible time intervals for observations of Io during the eastern elongation (90+/- 11 degrees) in the months June, July and August. These are the only months when the required configurations (C36-5 and C36-6) are planned to be scheduled.

There are two aspects to take into account:

- In August, Jupiter is getting close to the Sun. Therefore, observations in June or July are expected to be technically more feasible.

- The largest oppotision of Io occurs in March 2016. At these time the size of Io's disk is about 1.2 arcsec. However, the scheduled configuration (C36-2) does not provide high-enough angular resolution to achieve the science goals. On the other hand, during months June and July, the size of Io's disk is in the range 0.83-0.95 arcsec, and therefore still large enough to be properly resolved with the requested 0.15 arcsec beam. Looking at this in more detail: On June, the available configuration is C36-5 (0.2 arcsec resolution), and the size of Io's disk is 0.87-0.95 arcsec, which means that we will have 4-5 beams sampling the size of the disk. Similarly, on July, the available configuration is C36-6 (0.15 arcsec resolution), and the size of Io's disk is 0.82-0.87 arcsec, which means that we will have about 5-6 beams sampling the size of the disk. In both cases we can achieve our scientific goals.</prj:note>

                <prj:note>We have listed the possible time intervals for observations of Io during the eastern elongation (90+/- 11 degrees) in the months June, July and August. These are the only months when the required configurations (C36-5 and C36-6) are planned to be scheduled.

There are two aspects to take into account:

- In August, Jupiter is getting close to the Sun. Therefore, observations in June or July are expected to be technically more feasible.

- The largest oppotision of Io occurs in March 2016. At these time the size of Io's disk is about 1.2 arcsec. However, the scheduled configuration (C36-2) does not provide high-enough angular resolution to achieve the science goals. On the other hand, during months June and July, the size of Io's disk is in the range 0.83-0.95 arcsec, and therefore still large enough to be properly resolved with the requested 0.15 arcsec beam. Looking at this in more detail: On June, the available configuration is C36-5 (0.2 arcsec resolution), and the size of Io's disk is 0.87-0.95 arcsec, which means that we will have 4-5 beams sampling the size of the disk. Similarly, on July, the available configuration is C36-6 (0.15 arcsec resolution), and the size of Io's disk is 0.82-0.87 arcsec, which means that we will have about 5-6 beams sampling the size of the disk. In both cases we can achieve our scientific goals.</prj:note>

                <prj:note>We have listed the possible time intervals for observations of Io during the eastern elongation (90+/- 11 degrees) in the months June, July and August. These are the only months when the required configurations (C36-5 and C36-6) are planned to be scheduled.

There are two aspects to take into account:

- In August, Jupiter is getting close to the Sun. Therefore, observations in June or July are expected to be technically more feasible.

- The largest oppotision of Io occurs in March 2016. At these time the size of Io's disk is about 1.2 arcsec. However, the scheduled configuration (C36-2) does not provide high-enough angular resolution to achieve the science goals. On the other hand, during months June and July, the size of Io's disk is in the range 0.83-0.95 arcsec, and therefore still large enough to be properly resolved with the requested 0.15 arcsec beam. Looking at this in more detail: On June, the available configuration is C36-5 (0.2 arcsec resolution), and the size of Io's disk is 0.87-0.95 arcsec, which means that we will have 4-5 beams sampling the size of the disk. Similarly, on July, the available configuration is C36-6 (0.15 arcsec resolution), and the size of Io's disk is 0.82-0.87 arcsec, which means that we will have about 5-6 beams sampling the size of the disk. In both cases we can achieve our scientific goals.</prj:note>

Similarly, on July, the available configuration is C36-6 (0.15 arcsec resolution), and the size of Io's disk is 0.82-0.87 arcsec, which means that we will have about 5-6 beams sampling the size of the disk. In both cases we can achieve our scientific goals.</prj:note>

                <prj:note>We have listed the possible time intervals for observations of Io during the eastern elongation (90+/- 11 degrees) in the months June, July and August. These are the only months when the required configurations (C36-5 and C36-6) are planned to be scheduled.

There are two aspects to take into account:

- In August, Jupiter is getting close to the Sun. Therefore, observations in June or July are expected to be technically more feasible.

- The largest oppotision of Io occurs in March 2016. At these time the size of Io's disk is about 1.2 arcsec. However, the scheduled configuration (C36-2) does not provide high-enough angular resolution to achieve the science goals. On the other hand, during months June and July, the size of Io's disk is in the range 0.83-0.95 arcsec, and therefore still large enough to be properly resolved with the requested 0.15 arcsec beam.

                <prj:note>We have listed the possible time intervals for observations of Io during the eastern elongation (90+/- 11 degrees) in the months June, July and August. These are the only months when the required configurations (C36-5 and C36-6) are planned to be scheduled.

There are two aspects to take into account:

- In August, Jupiter is getting close to the Sun. Therefore, observations in June or July are expected to be technically more feasible.

- The largest oppotision of Io occurs in March 2016. At these time the size of Io's disk is about 1.2 arcsec. However, the scheduled configuration (C36-2) does not provide high-enough angular resolution to achieve the science goals. On the other hand, during months June and July, the size of Io's disk is in the range 0.83-0.95 arcsec, and therefore still large enough to be properly resolved with the requested 0.15 arcsec beam. Looking at this in more detail: On June, the available configuration is C36-5 (0.2 arcsec resolution), and the size of Io's disk is 0.87-0.95 arcsec, which means that we will have 4-5 beams sampling the size of the disk. Similarly, on July, the available configuration is C36-6 (0.15 arcsec resolution), and the size of Io's disk is 0.82-0.87 arcsec, which means that we will have about 5-6 beams sampling the size of the disk. In both cases we can achieve our scientific goals.</prj:note>

                <prj:note>We have listed the possible time intervals for observations of Io during the eastern elongation (90+/- 11 degrees) in the months June, July and August. These are the only months when the required configurations (C36-5 and C36-6) are planned to be scheduled.

There are two aspects to take into account:

- In August, Jupiter is getting close to the Sun. Therefore, observations in June or July are expected to be technically more feasible.

- The largest oppotision of Io occurs in March 2016. At these time the size of Io's disk is about 1.2 arcsec. However, the scheduled configuration (C36-2) does not provide high-enough angular resolution to achieve the science goals. On the other hand, during months June and July, the size of Io's disk is in the range 0.83-0.95 arcsec, and therefore still large enough to be properly resolved with the requested 0.15 arcsec beam. Looking at this in more detail: On June, the available configuration is C36-5 (0.2 arcsec resolution), and the size of Io's disk is 0.87-0.95 arcsec, which means that we will have 4-5 beams sampling the size of the disk. Similarly, on July, the available configuration is C36-6 (0.15 arcsec resolution), and the size of Io's disk is 0.82-0.87 arcsec, which means that we will have about 5-6 beams sampling the size of the disk. In both cases we can achieve our scientific goals.</prj:note>

        <prj:TechnicalJustification>
            <prj:justificationText>We have used the enhanced capabilities of the ALMA correlator to observe simultaneously six SO2 transitions in band 7 with a high spectral resolution (60 m/s), in dual polarization.

- Requested spectral resolution:
Although the typical linewidth of SO2 lines is around 0.7-1 km/s, we aim at detecting differences in velocity of a few hundreds of m/s (see Science Justification). We therefore plan to reach a spectral resolution of about 60 m/s that will suffice to investigate the velocity variation.

- Requested bandwidth:
We have set six spectral windows in dual polarization that provide a spectral resolution of 61 kHz, and a bandwidth of 58 MHz (or 50 km/s). This bandwidth is enough to ensure that the targeted lines stay within the band during the observation at any time (we have estimated that the sky frequency of each line may change by about +/-19 MHz).

- Broadband:
We have set up a broad band of 1.8 GHz (with a resolution of 0.8 km/s). This broad band has three different goals: (i) facilitate the process of calibration by complementing the narrow spectral windows, (ii) provide a sensitive image of the continuum to perform self-calibration, and (iii) to search for other S-bearing molecules (see Science Justification). We have placed this broad band in a frequency range that covers different transitions of molecules such as SO, SO+, S2O, S2O2, HOSO+, and H2S2.</prj:justificationText>

            <prj:justificationText>We request an angular resolution of 0.15 arcsec, and a maximum recoverable angular scale (LAS) of 1.5 arcsec.

- Requested angular resolution and largest angular scale:
We aim at resolving Io's disk in order to map the velocity shifts in its atmosphere. The size of Io is larger than 0.8 arcsec when observed away from conjuction. In order to sample its disk with at least 5 different beams (see below in time constraints section), we need to reach an angular resolution of 0.15 arcsec. This resolution will permit to search for variations in the velocity accross the satellite's disk.

This resolution can be obtained with configurations C36-5 and C36-6. Both configurations result in a largest angular scale of 1.4 or 2.2 arcsec, which suffice to recover the extension of Io's disk (around 1.2 arcsec).</prj:justificationText>

        </prj:TechnicalJustification>
        <prj:TechnicalJustification>
            <prj:justificationText>The main goal is the detection of several SO2 lines in band 7. The requested sensitivity is 7.3 mJy/beam (or 3.3 K) per 60-m/s channel. This will permit to detect lines with S/N &gt; 7. After stacking (see below) we plan to reach a S/N of 15.

- Line intensities and sensitivity:
Previous ALMA Cycle 0 observations of the SO2 transitions at 346.52 GHz and 346.65 GHz, show lines with intensities of 20 and 30 K. From the intensity of these two lines, together with the physical parameters (temperature and column density) derived in Moullet et al (2013), we have produced synthetic spectra of all the targeted SO2 lines (see Fig. 4 in the Science Justification). We have selected six SO2 lines with expected line intensities between 20 and 35 K.

We aim at detecting the lines with S/N &gt; 7. Therefore, we need to reach a sensitivity of 3.3 K, with a spectral resolution of 60 m/s (necessary to study the kinematics in the atmosphere, and to search for variations of a few m/s). We note that the six SO2 transitions have similar excitation conditions, and therefore can be stacked in order to improve the S/N of the final image. Stacking the six lines would result in a final sensitivity of 1.3 K (i.e., we can reach a final S/N of 15).

- Continuum sensitivity:
The continuum emission of Io is as bright as 1 Jy. With the proposed observations we plan to reach a good sensitivity in the broad band (around 0.05 mJy) that will permit to use the continuum emission of Io to self-calibrate the data and improve the final S/N of the line emission.</prj:justificationText>

        <prj:TechnicalJustification>
            <prj:justificationText>We have indicated the possible time intervals for observations during months June, July and August. These are the only three months when the required configurations (C36-5 and C36-6) are available. If the 12-m Array Configuration Schedule suffers modifications we can provide new time slots to carry out the observations.

In addition to the possible time slots, there are two other aspects to be considered:

- In August, Jupiter gets close to the Sun. Therefore, observations in June/July are preferred.

- The largest oppotision of Io occurs in March 2016. At these time the size of Io's disk is about 1.2 arcsec. However, the scheduled configuration (C36-2) does not provide high-enough angular resolution to achieve the science goals. On the other hand, during months June and July, the size of Io's disk is in the range 0.83-0.95 arcsec, and therefore still large enough to be properly resolved with the requested 0.15 arcsec beam. Looking at this in more detail: On June, the available configuration is C36-5 (0.2 arcsec resolution), and the size of Io's disk is 0.87-0.95 arcsec, which means that we will have 4-5 beams sampling the size of the disk. Similarly, on July, the available configuration is C36-6 (0.15 arcsec resolution), and the size of Io's disk is 0.82-0.87 arcsec, which means that we will have about 5-6 beams sampling the size of the disk. In both cases we can achieve our scientific goals.

!!! PLEASE NOTE !!!, there is a problem with the size of the box that contains the justification of the high data rate, we copy here the corresponding justification:
The high rate is necessary to observe 6 SO2 lines with a high spectral resolution (60 m/s). The high spectral resolution is necessary to resolve differences in velocity of a few hundreds m/s. While the observations of 6 lines permit to stack them and improve the finas S/N.

                <prj:note>We have listed the possible time intervals for observations of Io during the western elongation (270+/- 11 degrees) in the months June, July and August. These are the only months when the required configurations (C36-5 and C36-6) are planned to be scheduled.

There are two aspects to take into account:

- In August, Jupiter is getting close to the Sun. Therefore, observations in June or July are expected to be technically more feasible.

- The largest oppotision of Io occurs in March 2016. At these time the size of Io's disk is about 1.2 arcsec. However, the scheduled configuration (C36-2) does not provide high-enough angular resolution to achieve the science goals. On the other hand, during months June and July, the size of Io's disk is in the range 0.83-0.95 arcsec, and therefore still large enough to be properly resolved with the requested 0.15 arcsec beam. Looking at this in more detail: On June, the available configuration is C36-5 (0.2 arcsec resolution), and the size of Io's disk is 0.87-0.95 arcsec, which means that we will have 4-5 beams sampling the size of the disk. Similarly, on July, the available configuration is C36-6 (0.15 arcsec resolution), and the size of Io's disk is 0.82-0.87 arcsec, which means that we will have about 5-6 beams sampling the size of the disk. In both cases we can achieve our scientific goals.</prj:note>

- The largest oppotision of Io occurs in March 2016. At these time the size of Io's disk is about 1.2 arcsec. However, the scheduled configuration (C36-2) does not provide high-enough angular resolution to achieve the science goals. On the other hand, during months June and July, the size of Io's disk is in the range 0.83-0.95 arcsec, and therefore still large enough to be properly resolved with the requested 0.15 arcsec beam. Looking at this in more detail: On June, the available configuration is C36-5 (0.2 arcsec resolution), and the size of Io's disk is 0.87-0.95 arcsec, which means that we will have 4-5 beams sampling the size of the disk. Similarly, on July, the available configuration is C36-6 (0.15 arcsec resolution), and the size of Io's disk is 0.82-0.87 arcsec, which means that we will have about 5-6 beams sampling the size of the disk. In both cases we can achieve our scientific goals.</prj:note>

                <prj:note>We have listed the possible time intervals for observations of Io during the western elongation (270+/- 11 degrees) in the months June, July and August. These are the only months when the required configurations (C36-5 and C36-6) are planned to be scheduled.

There are two aspects to take into account:

- In August, Jupiter is getting close to the Sun. Therefore, observations in June or July are expected to be technically more feasible.

- The largest oppotision of Io occurs in March 2016. At these time the size of Io's disk is about 1.2 arcsec. However, the scheduled configuration (C36-2) does not provide high-enough angular resolution to achieve the science goals. On the other hand, during months June and July, the size of Io's disk is in the range 0.83-0.95 arcsec, and therefore still large enough to be properly resolved with the requested 0.15 arcsec beam. Looking at this in more detail: On June, the available configuration is C36-5 (0.2 arcsec resolution), and the size of Io's disk is 0.87-0.95 arcsec, which means that we will have 4-5 beams sampling the size of the disk. Similarly, on July, the available configuration is C36-6 (0.15 arcsec resolution), and the size of Io's disk is 0.82-0.87 arcsec, which means that we will have about 5-6 beams sampling the size of the disk. In both cases we can achieve our scientific goals.</prj:note>

                <prj:note>We have listed the possible time intervals for observations of Io during the western elongation (270+/- 11 degrees) in the months June, July and August. These are the only months when the required configurations (C36-5 and C36-6) are planned to be scheduled.

There are two aspects to take into account:

- In August, Jupiter is getting close to the Sun. Therefore, observations in June or July are expected to be technically more feasible.

- The largest oppotision of Io occurs in March 2016. At these time the size of Io's disk is about 1.2 arcsec. However, the scheduled configuration (C36-2) does not provide high-enough angular resolution to achieve the science goals. On the other hand, during months June and July, the size of Io's disk is in the range 0.83-0.95 arcsec, and therefore still large enough to be properly resolved with the requested 0.15 arcsec beam. Looking at this in more detail: On June, the available configuration is C36-5 (0.2 arcsec resolution), and the size of Io's disk is 0.87-0.95 arcsec, which means that we will have 4-5 beams sampling the size of the disk. Similarly, on July, the available configuration is C36-6 (0.15 arcsec resolution), and the size of Io's disk is 0.82-0.87 arcsec, which means that we will have about 5-6 beams sampling the size of the disk. In both cases we can achieve our scientific goals.</prj:note>

Looking at this in more detail: On June, the available configuration is C36-5 (0.2 arcsec resolution), and the size of Io's disk is 0.87-0.95 arcsec, which means that we will have 4-5 beams sampling the size of the disk. Similarly, on July, the available configuration is C36-6 (0.15 arcsec resolution), and the size of Io's disk is 0.82-0.87 arcsec, which means that we will have about 5-6 beams sampling the size of the disk. In both cases we can achieve our scientific goals.</prj:note>

            <prj:justificationText>We have used the enhanced capabilities of the ALMA correlator to observe simultaneously six SO2 transitions in band 7 with a high spectral resolution (60 m/s), in dual polarization.

- Requested spectral resolution:
Although the typical linewidth of SO2 lines is around 0.7-1 km/s, we aim at detecting differences in velocity of a few hundreds of m/s (see Science Justification). We therefore plan to reach a spectral resolution of about 60 m/s that will suffice to investigate the velocity variation.

- Requested bandwidth:
We have set six spectral windows in dual polarization that provide a spectral resolution of 61 kHz, and a bandwidth of 58 MHz (or 50 km/s). This bandwidth is enough to ensure that the targeted lines stay within the band during the observation at any time (we have estimated that the sky frequency of each line may change by about +/-19 MHz).

- Broadband:
We have set up a broad band of 1.8 GHz (with a resolution of 0.8 km/s). This broad band has three different goals: (i) facilitate the process of calibration by complementing the narrow spectral windows, (ii) provide a sensitive image of the continuum to perform self-calibration, and (iii) to search for other S-bearing molecules (see Science Justification). We have placed this broad band in a frequency range that covers different transitions of molecules such as SO, SO+, S2O, S2O2, HOSO+, and H2S2.</prj:justificationText>

            <prj:justificationText>We request an angular resolution of 0.15 arcsec, and a maximum recoverable angular scale (LAS) of 1.5 arcsec.

- Requested angular resolution and largest angular scale:
We aim at resolving Io's disk in order to map the velocity shifts in its atmosphere. The size of Io is larger than 0.8 arcsec when observed away from conjunction. In order to sample its disk with at least 5 different beams (see below in time constraints section), we need to reach an angular resolution of 0.15 arcsec. This resolution will permit to search for variations in the velocity accross the satellite's disk.

This resolution can be obtained with configurations C36-5 and C36-6. Both configurations result in a largest angular scale of 1.4 or 2.2 arcsec, which suffice to recover the extension of Io's disk (around 1.2 arcsec).</prj:justificationText>

        <prj:TechnicalJustification>
            <prj:justificationText>The main goal is the detection of several SO2 lines in band 7. The requested sensitivity is 7.3 mJy/beam (or 3.3 K) per 60-m/s channel. This will permit to detect lines with S/N &gt; 7. After stacking (see below) we plan to reach a S/N of 15.

- Line intensities and sensitivity:
Previous ALMA Cycle 0 observations of the SO2 transitions at 346.52 GHz and 346.65 GHz, show lines with intensities of 20 and 30 K. From the intensity of these two lines, together with the physical parameters (temperature and column density) derived in Moullet et al (2013), we have produced synthetic spectra of all the targeted SO2 lines (see Fig. 4 in the Science Justification). We have selected six SO2 lines with expected line intensities between 20 and 35 K.

We aim at detecting the lines with S/N &gt; 7. Therefore, we need to reach a sensitivity of 3.3 K, with a spectral resolution of 60 m/s (necessary to study the kinematics in the atmosphere, and to search for variations of a few m/s). We note that the six SO2 transitions have similar excitation conditions, and therefore can be stacked in order to improve the S/N of the final image. Stacking the six lines would result in a final sensitivity of 1.3 K (i.e., we can reach a final S/N of 15).

- Continuum sensitivity:
The continuum emission of Io is as bright as 1 Jy. With the proposed observations we plan to reach a good sensitivity in the broad band (around 0.05 mJy) that will permit to use the continuum emission of Io to self-calibrate the data and improve the final S/N of the line emission.</prj:justificationText>

            <prj:justificationText>We have indicated the possible time intervals for observations during months June, July and August. These are the only three months when the required configurations (C36-5 and C36-6) are available. If the 12-m Array Configuration Schedule suffers modifications we can provide new time slots to carry out the observations.

In addition to the possible time slots, there are two other aspects to be considered:

- In August, Jupiter gets close to the Sun. Therefore, observations in June/July are preferred.

- The largest oppotision of Io occurs in March 2016. At these time the size of Io's disk is about 1.2 arcsec. However, the scheduled configuration (C36-2) does not provide high-enough angular resolution to achieve the science goals. On the other hand, during months June and July, the size of Io's disk is in the range 0.83-0.95 arcsec, and therefore still large enough to be properly resolved with the requested 0.15 arcsec beam. Looking at this in more detail: On June, the available configuration is C36-5 (0.2 arcsec resolution), and the size of Io's disk is 0.87-0.95 arcsec, which means that we will have 4-5 beams sampling the size of the disk. Similarly, on July, the available configuration is C36-6 (0.15 arcsec resolution), and the size of Io's disk is 0.82-0.87 arcsec, which means that we will have about 5-6 beams sampling the size of the disk. In both cases we can achieve our scientific goals.</prj:justificationText>

    <prp:abstract>It is still unclear whether the dilute SO2 atmosphere of Jupiter's moon Io is primarily maintained by sublimation from SO2 surface frost or by Io's volcanoes. A sublimation driven atmosphere has strong day-night asymmetries resulting in strong pressure driven winds towards the night side. Because Io is located deeply within Jupiter's fast rotating magnetosphere, the resultant plasma drag also exerts a major force on Io's atmosphere.  When Io is at eastern (or western) elongation, the drag and pressure forces act in opposite (or parallel) directions resulting in weak (or strong) winds. We propose to investigate the forces that shape Io's atmosphere by measuring the winds across Io on both elongations. At eastern elongation we will significantly improve the spatial resolution of the previously observed weak winds. If we observe strong winds at western elongation, as predicted for a day-night asymmetry, we will prove Io's atmosphere to be primarily sublimation-driven. Weak winds at both elongations imply a volcanically driven atmosphere and much weaker drag forces than expected. The results will help to better understand similar force balances at other moons and close-in exoplanets. </prp:abstract>
